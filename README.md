Task 3 of my Data Analytics internship at Oasis Infobyte

Project title : Sentiment Analysis ( Level 1 )

The primary goal is to develop a sentiment analysis model that can accurately classify the sentiment of text data, providing valuable insights into public opinion, customer feedback, and social media trends.

I used a Dataset from Kaggle for this project ( Play Store Data ) 

üìçKey Concepts and Challenges:
1. Sentiment Analysis: Analyzing text data to determine the emotional tone, whether positive, negative, or neutral. 
2. Natural Language Processing (NLP): Utilizing algorithms and models to understand and process human language.
3. Feature Engineering: Identifying and extracting relevant features from text data to enhance model performance..
4. Data Visualization: Presenting sentiment analysis results through effective visualizations for clear interpretation.
